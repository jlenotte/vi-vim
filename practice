Remember also that movement commands take numeric arguments, so numbers can
be added to the text objects of 
c
, 
d
, and 
y
 commands. For example, 
d2w
 and 
2dw
 are
commands to delete two words. With this in mind, you can see that most 
vi
 commands
follow a general pattern:
(
command
)(
number
)(
text object
)
or the equivalent form:
(
number
)(
command
)(
text object
)
